# Golf-Ball-Flight-Simulation
A project I completed in 2017. The simulation of the flight of a golf ball, all done in excel. 
Load the file and have a toy about altering the inital conditions and constants and see how the trajectory of the ball changes. The idea was to find the driver angle that would optimise distance given a set of conditions.
