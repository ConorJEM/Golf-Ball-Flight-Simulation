# Golf-Ball-Flight-Simulation
A project I completed in 2017. The simulation of the flight of a golf ball, all done in excel. 
Load the file in excel then have a toy about altering the inital conditions and constants and see how the trajectory of the ball changes. Click the 'calculate optimum range' button to re-do the trajectory calculation. The idea was to find the driver angle that would optimise distance given a set of conditions.
